# OmniHub Reporting - Progress Log

## Completed Stages

### Stage 1.1 - Legacy Files Cleanup
- Cleared legacy files and directories to prepare for MySQL-based OmniHub Reporting implementation.

### Stage 1.15 - SQLite Dependency Cleanup & MySQL Initialization Restructure
- Decoupled `better-sqlite3` and `@types/better-sqlite3` from `package.json`.
- Restructured `src/lib/db.ts` to focus solely on MySQL connection pool initialization and verification.

### Stage 1.16 - MySQL Indexing Optimization Script
- Created `db_optimize.ts` in root directory.
- Configured index optimization for `systemlogs`, `videoresolutions`, `video_analytics`, and `views` tables to accelerate reporting queries.
- Added graceful handling for `ER_DUP_KEYNAME` if indexes already exist.
- Added `"db:optimize": "tsx db_optimize.ts"` to `package.json` scripts.

### Stage 1.17 - GPU Architecture Adaptive Profile (Auto-Detection)
- Added `execSync` to `child_process` import in `server.ts`.
- Implemented automatic GPU architecture detection (`nvidia-smi`) defaulting safely to legacy Maxwell profile when unavailable or legacy.
- Configured adaptive NVENC parameters for VOD (`buildPureGPUVRAMArgs`): preset `p4` vs `slow`, B-frames (`-bf 3` vs `-bf 0`), and AQ parameters.
- Configured adaptive NVENC parameters for RTMP Live Streaming (`vcParam`).

### Stage 1.18 - Schema Patch & Metrics Tracking (Duration & Downloads)
- Injected `duration` and `downloads` column auto-generation into `runDBSetup` in `server.ts`.
- Injected video duration persistence (`UPDATE Videos SET duration = ?`) inside FFmpeg probe data event listener.
- Injected non-blocking download count tracking (`downloads = downloads + 1`) into regular `/api/videos/download/:id/:res` and decrypted `/api/videos/download/:id` endpoints.

### Stage 1.19 - Reporting Aggregation API
- Added `/api/admin/reports/chart` endpoint supporting dynamic period grouping (`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`).
- Aggregated uploaded video counts, total duration in seconds, and total downloads from MySQL `Videos`.
- Query top 10 downloaded videos with download counts, views, and duration.
- Chronologically reversed chart results for smooth left-to-right Recharts rendering.

### Stage 1.20 - Create Reporting UI Dashboard
- Created `src/pages/AdminReporting.tsx` using `recharts` (`ResponsiveContainer`, `ComposedChart`, `Bar`, `Line`, `Tooltip`, `Legend`).
- Implemented interactive period filters (`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`).
- Added animated trends dashboard and Top 10 Downloaded Videos leaderboard.
- Securely retrieved auth token from localStorage for `/api/admin/reports/chart` requests.

### Stage 1.21 - Connect Reporting Page to Router & Sidebar
- Imported `AdminReporting` in `src/App.tsx`.
- Added `/admin/reports` route to the Admin Only RBAC block.
- Added "Reporting" sidebar navigation item under Admin section with `TrendingUp` icon.

### Stage 1.22 - Server I/O Optimization & Zombie Chunk Sweeper
- Converted synchronous file deletion operations (`fs.rmSync`, `fs.unlinkSync`) in archive cleanup and bulk-delete endpoints to non-blocking asynchronous `fs.promises.rm` and `fs.promises.unlink`.
- Converted synchronous `fs.readFileSync` in dynamic resolution filtering (`processVideo`) to asynchronous `await fs.promises.readFile`.
- Implemented `runChunkCleanup` background sweeper running every 12 hours to safely purge orphaned upload chunks older than 24 hours.

### Stage 1.23 - Frontend UI Unfreeze (Remove Canvas Base64 Extraction)
- Removed synchronous, heavy canvas base64 frame extraction (`generateLocalVideoThumbnail`) from `src/pages/Upload.tsx`.
- Refactored `handleFileSelect` to map synchronous object URLs directly without blocking the main browser thread.
- Streamlined local video preview card to exclusively rely on native `<video>` element with frame cueing at 1.0s, eliminating the conditional `<img>` render.

### Stage 1.24 - Extreme NVENC Compression & Aggressive Chunk Cleanup
- Lowered bitrate and bufsize targets across all `RESOLUTION_PROFILES` for high visual efficiency.
- Upgraded modern NVENC transcoding parameters to `-preset p7`, `-profile:v high`, and `-multipass 2` (two-pass encoding) in `buildPureGPUVRAMArgs`.
- Upgraded `runChunkCleanup` frequency to hourly with a tighter 3-hour expiration threshold for abandoned chunks.
- Added immediate orphaned chunk deletion in the `/api/video/abort-processing` endpoint.

### Stage 1.25 - Explore Page & Router Integration
- Created `src/pages/Explore.tsx` responsive video catalog interface.
- Implemented sticky category filter bar supporting standard category IDs (`1=Entertainment`, `2=Education`, `3=Gaming`, `4=Music`, `5=Technology`) and dynamic views-based `Trending` sorting.
- Styled modern video grid with Tailwind CSS and smooth framer-motion entry animations.
- Added time-ago relative date formatting and hover overlay with play badge.
- Connected `ExplorePage` to React Router in `src/App.tsx` under public routes (`/explore`).

### Stage 1.26 - User History & Watch Later Backend Architecture
- Provisioned MySQL `WatchHistory` and `WatchLater` tables with UNIQUE constraints (`unique_history`, `unique_watch_later`) and CASCADE foreign key relationships.
- Injected authenticated endpoints for History (`GET /api/user/history`, `POST /api/user/history` with ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE).
- Injected authenticated endpoints for Watch Later (`GET /api/user/watch-later`, `POST /api/user/watch-later`, `DELETE /api/user/watch-later/:videoId`).

### Stage 1.27 - Watch History & Watch Later Pages and Router Integration
- Created `src/pages/History.tsx` watch history client interface fetching `/api/user/history` with JWT auth.
- Created `src/pages/WatchLater.tsx` watch later client interface fetching `/api/user/watch-later` with interactive item removal (`DELETE /api/user/watch-later/:videoId`).
- Built responsive video grids using Tailwind CSS, motion stagger animations, and relative time formatting.
- Connected `/history` and `/watch-later` to React Router under Protected Routes (RBAC) in `src/App.tsx`.

### Stage 1.28 - Liked Videos Backend, UI Page & Router Integration
- Injected authenticated `GET /api/user/liked-videos` route into `server.ts`.
- Joined `Likes`, `Videos`, and `Users` tables filtering for `type = 'like'` and `status = 'ready'`, ordered chronologically (`liked_at DESC`).
- Created `src/pages/Liked.tsx` liked videos interface with authenticated fetch, motion entrance animations, and responsive grid layout.
- Connected `/liked` to React Router under Protected Routes (RBAC) in `src/App.tsx`.

### Stage 1.29 - Security Hardening (Helmet & Rate Limiting)
- Installed and imported `helmet` and `express-rate-limit`.
- Configured global `helmet` middleware with cross-origin resource policy support.
- Configured `globalLimiter` (1500 req/15min) across all `/api/` endpoints.
- Configured strict `authLimiter` (5 req/15min) on `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login` to prevent brute-force attacks.

### Stage 1.30 - Cross-OS Compatibility (Windows/Linux Process Killer)
- Imported standard `os` module into `server.ts`.
- Configured `{ detached: os.platform() !== 'win32' }` in `executePureGPUVRAMTranscoding` spawn command to create independent process groups on POSIX systems.
- Upgraded `/api/video/abort-processing` process termination to execute OS-aware deep cleanup (`taskkill /PID ... /T /F` on Windows, `process.kill(-proc.pid, 'SIGKILL')` on Linux/Mac) with graceful fallback.

### Stage 1.31 - Create Smart Setup Wizard & Launcher
- Created `launcher.js` interactive setup wizard and application launcher in root.
- Integrated hardware inspection (OS and `nvidia-smi` GPU detection).
- Implemented deployment mode selection: Docker containerized vs monolithic bare-metal.
- Added dynamic `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` generation with NVIDIA GPU resource reservation.
- Configured `.omnihub-setup-done` configuration lock mechanism and cross-platform process spawning.
- Upgraded bare-metal monolithic spawn runner to execute via `tsx` instead of `ts-node` for clean Node.js 20/22+ ESM runtime compatibility.

### Stage 1.32 - Wizard Diagnostic Menu & CSP Hardening
- Configured Content Security Policy in `server.ts` helmet middleware with Vite HMR-safe directives (`ws:`, `wss:`, `'unsafe-inline'`, `'unsafe-eval'`).
- Imported `mysql2/promise` in `launcher.js` and implemented `testMySQLConnection` and `createDatabaseIfNotExists` diagnostic utilities.
- Upgraded `launcher.js` interactive installation wizard to include option 3 for local MySQL connection diagnosis and loop back to main menu.
- Added automatic MySQL credential verification and database auto-creation (`CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS`) before proceeding with monolithic deployment.

### Stage 1.33 - Fix Env Variables & Inject Core Auto-Migration
- Standardized MySQL password environment variable in `src/lib/db.ts` to `process.env.DB_PASS` (aligning with `.env` generator in launcher).
- Injected automated DDL migration inside `initDB` in `src/lib/db.ts` for core `Users` and `Videos` tables with appropriate schemas, indexes, and CASCADE constraints.

### Stage 1.34 - Strict .env Synchronization (Eliminate Hardcoded Fallbacks)
- Removed hardcoded fallback credentials and database names in `createConnectionPool` and `initDB` in `src/lib/db.ts`.
- Enforced strict reliance on `process.env` (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_NAME`) as generated by `launcher.js`.
- Added critical error diagnostic logging if `DB_NAME` is missing from the runtime environment.

### Stage 1.35 - Force Database Target in MySQL Connection & Ensure Table Creation
- Updated `initDB` in `src/lib/db.ts` to directly connect with target `{ database }` parameter, ensuring DDL executions target the exact schema.
- Added validation log for missing `DB_NAME`.
- Replaced connection destroy with graceful `await connection.end()` upon successful table creation and initialization.

### Stage 1.36 - Server CLI Shortcut [4] Auto-Restart Implementation
- Fixed terminal crash/shutdown on shortcut `[4]` by replacing broken uncompiled `node server.ts` spawn with a supervisor loop architecture in `launcher.js`.
- Implemented `OMNIHUB_SUPERVISOR` environment mapping and exit code `42` signaling for clean in-terminal application reboots.
- Injected `gracefulRestart` in `server.ts` to release port 3000 (`server.close()`) and MySQL connection pool (`db.end()`) cleanly before restart.
- Updated `lib/dashboard.ts` keyboard `[4]` listener to cleanly destroy blessed terminal screen and invoke graceful restart.
- Updated `npm run dev` script in `package.json` to route through `node launcher.js`, maintaining the restart supervisor loop across both startup commands.

### Stage 1.37 - YouTube-Style Responsive Navigation Bar & Sidebar
- Refactored `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` to precisely match YouTube navigation layout across both unauthenticated (Gambar 1) and authenticated (Gambar 2) states.
- Implemented unauthenticated layout featuring Home, Shorts, Subscriptions, You, History, prominent Sign-in Promo Card, Explore categories, More from OmniHub, and footer copyright links.
- Implemented authenticated layout featuring Beranda, Shorts, Subscriptions with live channel avatars & activity indicators, Library ("Anda >") routes, Admin Control routes, Explore categories, and footer.
- Implemented desktop collapsible mini-sidebar mode (72px) toggled via the navbar hamburger menu button.
- Added top navbar "+ Buat" (Upload) action button, YouTube-styled pill sign-in button, and `GET /api/channels` endpoint for dynamic channel fetching.
